The features required were sleep duration, favorite food and favorite mode of transportation. Place of Interest(hilly or sea areas) was compared individually with 3 
dependent variables and it was found out that students of average sleeping durations(8 hrs), travelling by rickshaw, liking Bangladeshi food
prefer sea areas. On the other hand, students preferring hilly areas follow irregular pattern that is, some sleep less some more and some travel by
cycle and few by rickshaws and choice of food is more towards Bangladeshi compared to Western. The datasets were the result of a survey conducted among 130 students so it can be concluded that students preferring
sea as holiday destination follow a more regular pattern of lifestyle compared to students preferring hilly areas.
